        Agentic AI is transforming commerce and services; agents are
        negotiating, transacting and making decisions with growing autonomy and
        impact. While agents can amplify consumer power, there is also risk of
        privacy breaches, misaligned incentives, and manipulative business
        practices. Trust and security are essential for consumers and businesses
        alike.
